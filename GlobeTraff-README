GlobeTraff is tool for the generation of synthetic traffic mixes. 
The implementation is based on the WebTraff/ProwGen tool(s):

GlobeTraff uses WebTraff/ProwGen for the generation of Web workloads.
In addition it supports the generation of P2P and Video workloads, as 
well as a generic type of workload. The implementation provides a Java
based front end for the parameterization of the respective models.

INSTALLATION
------------

The implementation consists of two parts. The first one is the extended
ProwGen code and it can be compiled by simply running the "setup" script.
The second part is the Java front end (JavaGUI). It has been developed 
as a NetBeans project, so it can be easily  imported to NetBeans and run 
through the corsesponding interface. Else, the source code is located 
in the JavaGUI/src directory and it can be compiled and run with the 
"javac" and "java" commands respectively. Note, that in order to 
properly prepare and mix the traffic workloads, the Java code uses the 
following scripts located in the JavaGUI directory: cleanup, freq, 
lrustack, numWebDocs, numWebRequests,postprocess,sizeSamples.
